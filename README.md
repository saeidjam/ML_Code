# ML_Code + DataSet

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of the main algorithms in machine learning (ML). It includes a curated collection of datasets alongside source code for various ML algorithms.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate the practical application of machine learning algorithms on real-world datasets. It serves as a resource for learning and testing ML concepts.

## Contents

- Source code for implementing ML algorithms.
- Datasets used for training and testing the algorithms.
- Documentation explaining each algorithm and its use case.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get started with the ML algorithms and datasets.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Relevant ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)


### Datasets

The datasets are located in the `datasets` directory. Each dataset has a corresponding README with details on the source, structure, and any preprocessing done.
